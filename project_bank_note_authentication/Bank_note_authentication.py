# # Authentication of banknote using machine learning algorithm

# Despite a decrease in the use of currency due to the recent growth in the use of electronic transactions, cash transactions remain very important in the global market.
# 
# Banknotes are used to carry out financial activities. To continue with smooth cash transactions, entry of forged banknotes in circulation should be preserved. 
# 
# There has been a drastic increase in the rate of fake notes in the market.
# 
# Fake money is an imitation of the genuine notes and is created illegally for various motives. 
# 
# These fake notes are created in all denominations which brings the financial market of the country to a low level. 
# 
# The various advancements in the field of scanners and copy machines have led the miscreants to create copies of banknotes.
# 
# It is difficult for human-eye to recognize a fake note because they are created with great accuracy to look alike a genuine note.
# 
# Security aspects of banknotes have to be considered and security features are to be introduced to mitigate fake currency. Hence, there is a dire need in banks and ATM machines to implement a system that classifies a note as genuine or fake.

# # Problem Definition

# The task here is to predict whether a bank currency note is authentic or not based on four attributes i.e. variance of the image wavelet transformed image, skewness, entropy, and curtosis of the image.

# # Solution

# We will use a random forest and support vector machine to solve this problem in terms of performance and conclude which algorithm gives more accuracy.

# # DataSet Description

# The dataset used to train the models is taken from UCI machine learning repository .
# 
# Data were extracted from genuine and counterfeit banknote images. 
# 
# The dataset has 1372 instances.
# 
# There are 5 attributes out of which 4 are the features and one is the target attribute.
# 
# The dataset contains a balanced ratio of both classes which is 55:45(genuine: counterfeit).
# 
# The target class contains two values: 0 and 1 where 0 represents genuine note and 1 represents fake note.

# # Conclusion

# We compared two different algorithms in terms of performance and concluded that the Random Forest algorithms is the best algorithm for banknote authentication with an accuracy of 98.90%.
